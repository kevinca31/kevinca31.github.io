        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>I'm based in Seattle and currently studying <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/informatics">Informatics</a> at the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>.</p>

        <p>I am currently working on research at the Clean Energy Testbeds. The purpose of the lab is to develop an algorithm to find the most effective way of lining
          busbars and fingers to absorb more sunlight and transfer power more efficiently. This will save money for those who use solar cells as well as make them but also
          conserves energy. I had to teach myself python in order to succeed in this position.

          <p>As outlined in our Final Project:
            "The focus of Husky Help is to connect the homeless with resources they need to sustain
            themselves. The COVID-19 pandemic has made life harder since most people are enclosed
            inside and cannot help the homeless. Husky Help aims to connect the homeless population to
            the supporting organizations.
            Due to the stay at home order, people cannot donate to the homeless. This creates an
            insufficient resource problem that negatively impacts the homeless. It is important to address
            this problem because weâ€™re without a proper infrastructure. Many people lack the support to get
            a job or achieve basic necessities.
            With a possibility of a recession occurring around the corner, there are a lot of economic
            motivations along with ethical reasons in solving this problem. By providing a better support
            3
            infrastructure, more homeless people will have an opportunity to leave the streets. Another
            motivation is that this project is directly helping the people that are in need. Also, providing a
            proper support infrastructure can help reduce the spread of COVID-19 by informing people of
            safe practices. This project can indirectly help the local community as a whole."

          <p>As outlined in our Final Project:
            "Our domain is focused on analyzing **US police shootings** from 2015 to 2020. We found this to be an important
            and relevant data set in light of recent events and the
            high group interest in the topic. The data we collected was organized by Ahsen Nazir and has been updated within
             the last three months. There are 4895 recorded observations (unique shootings) in that data set with 15
             columns of information such as name, manner of death, age, gender, location, and many others. Specifically, we
             chose to analyze patterns between shootings and race, shootings per year, as well as the distribution of age for each race."
